# About Me

My name is **Tomislav Šereg**, and I live and work in Zagreb, Croatia. I’ve been professionally involved in software development for over 30 years. Currently, I work on the development of a general Laboratory Information System (LIS) product, where I participate in the entire development lifecycle – from analyzing user requirements to design, implementation, and support.

My daily work involves technologies such as **C#, C++, Visual Basic, .NET, Win32 API, SQL, and XML**, but over the years I’ve worked with a wide range of other tools and platforms depending on project needs.

Two projects I’m particularly proud of:

- **The complete independent development of a LIS** for a hospital in Croatia.
- **A programmable communication component** implementing protocols for over 200 medical laboratory analyzer models.

Programming has been both my profession and passion since elementary school, when I wrote my first lines of code on an Atari 800 XL.
