title: WinUI Primer
---

## Introduction

This tutorial starts off with as little development tools and libraries as possible. We (1) set up a most basic development environment, (2) test it, (3) write and build a simplest application possible, and then (4) start exploring UI design using elements available "out of the box".

In actual production you will most probably use one of the popular cross-platform UI frameworks like MAUI, Avalonia UI, Uno, or React Native. What you'll learn here may allow you to understand some of those other frameworks better, but you should consider your investment in learning WinUI if you don't plan to use it or use framework with simmilar approach, like MAUI.

Also, don't be shy to consult with the AI tool of your choice while following this primer.
