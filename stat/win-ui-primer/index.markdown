# Introduction

This tutorial starts off with as little development tools and libraries as possible. We (1) set up a most basic development environment, (2) test it, (3) write and build a simplest application possible, and then (4) start exploring UI design and building using elements available out-of-box.

In actual production you will most probably use some of the popular UI frameworks like MAUI, Angular or Uno, but what you'll learn here will allow you to understand these other frameworks better.

Also, don't be shy to consult with the AI tool of your choice while following this primer.
