title: WinUI Primer
---

## Introduction

This tutorial starts off with as little development tools and libraries as possible. We set up a most basic development environment, test it, write and build a simplest application possible, and then start exploring UI design using WinUI 3 elements available "out of the box".

In actual production you will most probably use one of the popular cross-platform UI frameworks like MAUI, Avalonia UI, Uno, or React Native. What you'll learn here might allow you to understand some of those other frameworks better. You should, however, reconsider your investment in learning WinUI if you don't plan to use it and if you don't plan to use a framework with a similar approach, like MAUI.

Also, don't be shy to consult with the AI tool of your choice while following this primer.
