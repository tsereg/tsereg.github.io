I’ve been professionally involved in software development for over 30 years. Currently, I work on the maintenance of a general-purpose Laboratory Information System (LIS), where I take part in the entire development lifecycle – from analyzing user requirements to design, implementation, and support. I also manage the development and documentation processes at the company I work for.

My daily work involves technologies such as **C#, C++, Visual Basic, .NET, Win32 API, SQL, and XML**, though over the years I’ve worked with a wide range of other tools and platforms depending on project needs.

Two projects I’m particularly fond of:

- **The complete independent development of a custom LIS** for a hospital in Croatia that handles around 1,000 laboratory visits per day and operates 24/7. I was the sole developer responsible for analysis, design, implementation, and user training. I completed the project in approximately 18 months and continued to maintain and fully support it for 15 years.
- **A programmable communication component** that I began developing as a student, which I’ve since used to implement communication protocols for just under 200 models of medical laboratory analyzers.

Programming has been both my profession and passion since elementary school, when I wrote my first lines of code on an Atari 800 XL. I graduated from a 5-year study program at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, earning the title *Dipl.-Ing. in Computing*, which is equivalent to a Master of Science in Computing (*mag. ing. comp.*) currently awarded by the same faculty.

I live and work in Zagreb, Croatia.
